# U-Net-model-NMA-DL

With the advancement of technology, computer vision has found numerous applications in various fields, including medicine. In the medical domain, computer vision techniques are being used for the detection of various conditions, such as brain tumors. This study aimed to review the existing literature and implement different approaches, including semantic segmentation, to detect different types of  MRI brain tumors images using pytorch.
